### IMPORTANT ###

The spotify api only allows the first 30 seconds for each song and you can search 
song by artist or song name. But due to the Spotify Api, there are a few songs don't
have a valid link, thus, the song would not play. It would work like a normal song, ie. can be added to a playlist, able to be skipped, etc. but it would just not play the song. 

The api will provide at most 20 songs with their image, release date
artist.

You can changed the color scheme in the upper left hand corner, using a drop down menu.
You can sort the User's Library using the drop Box in the top middle, by artist, title, or release date. By default, the user library will be sorted by titles.
To search for a song, simply enter the name of the song in the search bar.
This will show results in the Main Library on the right hand side of the UI.
Select a song out of the main library, and choose to either add the song
to the user library or play it directly. The right library will be cleaned every time you 
make a new search. The Play and Pause buttons simply start and stop playing the current song.  The Skip and Prev buttons move forward and backward
in the User's Library.  After the Play User's Library button is clicked (if the user
library is populated). It will start playing from the first song and will do a list loop.
If you don't add any songs and click play, nothing will happen.

The seekBar is to adjust the position of the audio playback.
The volume bar is for adjust the volume.
